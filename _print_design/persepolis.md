I created this poster for the Film Arts Committee at Calvin College to promote a free showing of the film adapatation of Marjane Satrapi\'s *Persepolis*. The pattern is a tracing of paths in Tehran\'s [Azadi Square](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tehran,+Iran/@35.699658,51.3373147,389m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x3f8e00491ff3dcd9:0xf0b3697c567024bc). The cartoon image of Marjane Satrapi comes from the *Persepolis* cover art. I believe that this qualifies as fair use under United States copyright law as the purpose was noncommercial, the work was published, only a small portion was reproduced, and it does not in any way diminish the original work\'s value (in fact, it promotes the original work).
