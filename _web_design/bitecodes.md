I built this site for a friend of mine who had an idea to store nutritional information in QR codes. The site is a proof-of-concept that we hope to eventually build into a mobile app. I built the site using Angular.js and serve it from GitHub Pages.

You try it out here: [bitecod.es](http://bitecod.es)
