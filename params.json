{"name":"John Muyskens","tagline":"My personal site.","body":"I am a computer science undergraduate at [Calvin College](http://www.calvin.edu/). I am interested in information design, from data visualization to user interfaces to graphic design. Bret Victor, Edward Tufte and Mike Bostock inspire me. I speak Python, Haskell and JavaScript. My other interests include listening to music, reading and biking. I work for the [Student Activities Office](http://www.calvin.edu/sao) at Calvin where we put on a concert season like no other. Our offerings also include recent movies, comedy and pop-culture lectures. I make posters advertising these events across campus, a service I also provide pro bono for the Film Arts Committee. I am also the Science & Technology Editor at our school newspaper, [The Chimes](http://www.calvin.edu/chimes). ","google":"UA-41466414-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
